# Laravel Docker Setup

This repository contains the necessary files to set up a Laravel project using Docker. Docker allows you to create isolated environments for your application, making it easy to manage dependencies and ensure consistent development and deployment across different systems.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

To start working on the Laravel project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-laravel-docker-repo.git
   cd your-laravel-docker-repo
   ```

2. Configure Environment Variables:
   In the `.env` file, you can customize environment variables such as database connection details, application environment, etc., to suit your needs.

3. Build and Start Containers:
   Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

4. Install Laravel Dependencies:
   Access the Laravel workspace container to install PHP dependencies using Composer:
   ```
   docker-compose exec app composer install
   ```

5. Generate Laravel Key (Optional):
   Generate the application key for Laravel using the following command:
   ```
   docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. Access the Application:
   You can access your Laravel application in your web browser at `http://localhost:port`.

7. Working on the Project:
   You can start editing your Laravel project files locally, and the changes will be reflected inside the Docker container. To run Laravel commands, prefix them with `docker-compose exec app`, for example:
   ```
   docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
   ```

8. Stopping the Containers:
   To stop the Docker containers, run:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Customization

Feel free to modify the Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and other configuration files according to your project's requirements.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this guide assumes a basic understanding of Docker and Laravel. If you're new to either of these technologies, it's recommended to go through their official documentation to understand the concepts and best practices.

For Docker: [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
For Laravel: [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs)

Happy coding!
